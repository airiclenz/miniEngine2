============

An Arduino based multi-axis-motion-control system for time-lapse and video photogtaphy.

This repository contains all that is needed to build a full miniEngine 2 system. It contains:

	- Software
	- Hardware (PCB Gerber files)
	- Documentation
	- Licenses

Note of thanks
--------------

Four of the six contained software libraries were developed by me but two were not:

The library UTFT (here in version 2.0) was developed by Henning Karlsen

The DueTimer library was developed by Ivan Seidel 
https://github.com/ivanseidel/DueTimer

A big „Thank you“ to both of you for making these libraries available!
